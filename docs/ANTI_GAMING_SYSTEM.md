## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The ROXN Anti-Gaming System is designed to ensure fair, transparent, and effective distribution of ROXN tokens as rewards for contributions to GitHub repositories. This system addresses potential exploitation vectors, ensures quality contributions are appropriately valued, and maintains the integrity of the reward mechanism. 

By implementing these anti-gaming measures, the platform aims to:

1. **Maintain Token Value**: Ensure ROXN tokens are distributed for genuine value-adding contributions
2. **Reward Authenticity**: Prevent artificial inflation of contributions or metrics
3. **Protect Community Trust**: Maintain fairness for all participants
4. **Ensure Sustainability**: Prevent exhaustion of reward pools through gaming
5. **Support Quality Contributions**: Prioritize substantive, meaningful work over quantity

### 1.2 Potential Exploitation Vectors

The system specifically addresses the following potential exploitation vectors:

1. **Low-Quality Contributions**: Minimal or trivial PRs, comments, or issues created solely to farm rewards
2. **Sock Puppet Accounts**: Multiple accounts controlled by the same individual to multiply rewards
3. **Collusion**: Collaborating users approving each other's low-quality contributions
4. **Repository Spam**: Creating multiple repositories to artificially increase opportunities for rewards
5. **Commit Manipulation**: Breaking changes into unnecessarily small commits to increase count
6. **Issue Inflation**: Creating duplicate or unnecessary issues to claim rewards
7. **Self-Approval**: Creating and approving one's own contributions (through direct or indirect means)
8. **Automated Contributions**: Bot-generated PRs, comments, or other activities

## 2. Contribution Quality Assessment

### 2.1 Quality Metrics

Contributions are evaluated based on multiple quality factors:

1. **Code Complexity Analysis**
   - Lines of code changed (with diminishing returns for excessive changes)
   - Cyclomatic complexity of added/modified code
   - Test coverage of new code
   - Code duplication ratio

2. **Documentation Quality**
   - Completeness of comments and documentation
   - Clarity and usefulness of commit messages
   - Quality of PR descriptions
   - Inclusion of tests/examples

3. **Peer Assessment**
   - Number and quality of reviews received
   - Reviewer reputation and expertise
   - Time spent by reviewers
   - Discussion depth and constructiveness

4. **Issue Resolution Impact**
   - Issue priority and severity
   - Time the issue was open
   - Number of users affected
   - Alignment with repository roadmap

### 2.2 Contribution Scoring

Every contribution receives a score based on a weighted combination of the quality metrics:

```
ContributionScore = 
    (CodeComplexityScore × 0.35) + 
    (DocumentationScore × 0.15) + 
    (PeerAssessmentScore × 0.30) + 
    (IssueResolutionScore × 0.20)
```

Each component score is normalized to a 0-100 scale, with specific scoring algorithms:

1. **Code Complexity Score**:
   ```
   CodeComplexityScore = 
       min(LinesChanged × ComplexityFactor × TestCoverageFactor, 100)
   ```

2. **Documentation Score**:
   ```
   DocumentationScore = 
       (CommentQuality × 0.25) + 
       (CommitMessageQuality × 0.25) + 
       (PRDescriptionQuality × 0.25) + 
       (TestDocumentationQuality × 0.25)
   ```

3. **Peer Assessment Score**:
   ```
   PeerAssessmentScore = 
       (ReviewCount × ReviewQualityAvg × ReviewerReputationAvg × 20)
   ```

4. **Issue Resolution Score**:
   ```
   IssueResolutionScore = 
       (IssuePriority × 20) + 
       (TimeOpenFactor × 20) + 
       (UserImpactFactor × 40) + 
       (RoadmapAlignmentFactor × 20)
   ```

### 2.3 Minimum Quality Thresholds

To prevent reward farming with minimal contributions, the system enforces minimum quality thresholds:

1. **Overall Contribution Score**: Minimum score of 30/100 required for any reward
2. **Code Changes**: Minimum meaningful change threshold (context-dependent)
3. **Review Requirements**: At least one review from a trusted contributor
4. **Documentation Requirements**: Minimum documentation standards for PRs

Contributions falling below these thresholds receive no rewards, and repeated submissions of below-threshold contributions may trigger additional scrutiny.

## 3. Time-Weighted Reward Mechanisms

### 3.1 Contribution History Valuation

The system values sustained contribution over time rather than one-time bursts of activity:

1. **Contribution History Tracking**:
   - Maintains a 6-month rolling history of contributions
   - Analyzes pattern and consistency of contributions
   - Weights recent activity higher but rewards long-term engagement

2. **Historical Multiplier**:
   ```
   HistoricalMultiplier = 1.0 + (0.05 × min(ContributionMonths, 12))
   ```
   This provides up to a 60% bonus for contributors with 12+ months of activity.

3. **Decay Function**:
   - Inactivity gradually reduces the historical multiplier
   - After 3 months of inactivity, contributions start fresh

### 3.2 Sustained Engagement Multipliers

To reward consistent contributors, the system implements engagement multipliers:

1. **Consecutive Activity Bonus**:
   - Bonus for contributions in consecutive weeks/months
   - Up to 25% additional rewards for 6+ consecutive months of activity

2. **Diverse Contribution Bonus**:
   - Rewards contributing in multiple ways (code, issues, reviews)
   - Up to 20% bonus for balanced contribution across categories

3. **Milestone Achievements**:
   - Special bonuses at contribution count milestones
   - Recognition and increased reward rate at significant thresholds

### 3.3 Activity Consistency Requirements

The system discourages sporadic "farming" behavior:

1. **Consistency Check**:
   - Suspicious patterns trigger automatic review
   - Unusual spikes in activity receive additional scrutiny

2. **Cool-down Periods**:
   - Maximum rewards per day/week/month caps
   - Rate limiting for new contributors

3. **Balanced Activity Requirements**:
   - Highly active contributors must demonstrate balance
   - Pure volume without quality or diversity is flagged

## 4. Repository Reputation System

### 4.1 Repository Trust Scoring

Not all repositories are treated equally for reward purposes:

1. **Repository Trust Score**:
   ```
   RepoTrustScore = 
       (AgeScore × 0.20) + 
       (ActivityScore × 0.20) + 
       (ContributorDiversityScore × 0.20) + 
       (QualityMetricsScore × 0.20) + 
       (ExternalImpactScore × 0.20)
   ```

2. **Trust Factors**:
   - Repository age and consistent activity
   - Number and diversity of contributors
   - Code quality metrics and test coverage
   - Community impact (stars, forks, citations)
   - Integration with other trusted projects

3. **Trust Tiers**:
   - Tier 1: Highly trusted (score > 80)
   - Tier 2: Trusted (score 60-80)
   - Tier 3: Standard (score 40-60)
   - Tier 4: New/Unproven (score 20-40)
   - Tier 5: Suspicious (score < 20)

### 4.2 Repository Categories

Repositories are categorized to enable appropriate comparison and reward scaling:

1. **Size Categories**:
   - Small (< 10,000 LOC)
   - Medium (10,000 - 100,000 LOC)
   - Large (> 100,000 LOC)

2. **Project Type Categories**:
   - Application
   - Library/Framework
   - Tool/Utility
   - Documentation/Resource
   - Research/Experimental

3. **Development Stage**:
   - Early Stage/MVP
   - Active Development
   - Maintenance Mode
   - Deprecated/Archive

### 4.3 Impact on Reward Allocation

Repository classification directly affects reward distribution:

1. **Reward Multipliers by Trust Tier**:
   - Tier 1: 1.5x base reward rate
   - Tier 2: 1.2x base reward rate
   - Tier 3: 1.0x base reward rate
   - Tier 4: 0.8x base reward rate
   - Tier 5: 0.5x base reward rate or manual review only

2. **Category-Specific Adjustments**:
   - Different contribution types valued differently by category
   - Context-aware scoring based on repository type
   - Stage-appropriate reward emphasis

3. **Dynamic Adjustment**:
   - Repository scores updated monthly
   - Migration between tiers includes grace periods
   - Appeal process for tier classification

## 5. Sybil Resistance

### 5.1 Identity Verification

To prevent multiple accounts from the same individual gaming the system:

1. **GitHub Account Requirements**:
