## 1. Overview

This document specifies the governance framework for the ROXN token ecosystem, which powers the Roxonn platform. It outlines how decisions will be made, who can participate in governance, how voting works, and how the governance system will evolve over time.

The ROXN governance system is designed to:
- Ensure the platform's long-term sustainability and growth
- Gradually transition from centralized to decentralized governance
- Allow contributors and stakeholders to have a voice in the platform's direction
- Provide safeguards against malicious proposals while enabling innovation
- Integrate with the platform's core mission of rewarding open-source contributions

## 2. Governance Philosophy

The ROXN governance philosophy is based on the following principles:

- **Progressive Decentralization**: Start with centralized governance for security and efficiency, then gradually decentralize as the ecosystem matures.
- **Contributor-Centric**: Give greater voice to active contributors who are driving value in the ecosystem.
- **Transparency**: All governance decisions and voting must be transparent and verifiable.
- **Security First**: Implement safeguards to protect against attacks, exploitation, and hasty decisions.
- **Flexibility**: Allow the governance system itself to be upgraded through governance proposals.
- **Inclusivity**: Design mechanisms that allow participation regardless of token holdings size.

## 3. Phased Governance Approach

### 3.1 Phase 1: Foundation (0-6 months)

During the initial phase after token launch, governance will be primarily controlled by the core team to ensure security, rapid development, and responsiveness.

**Characteristics:**
- **Decision Making**: Core team multi-sig wallet (3-of-5) makes most decisions
- **Community Input**: Off-chain voting via Snapshot for non-binding community sentiment
- **Proposal Creation**: Limited to core team and strategic partners
- **Key Parameters**: Token distribution, reward rates, platform fees
- **Transparency**: All decisions documented publicly with rationale

**Governance Contracts:**
- Simple multi-sig wallet for administrative functions
- Snapshot for off-chain voting and signaling

### 3.2 Phase 2: Transition (6-18 months)

As the ecosystem grows, governance will begin transitioning to a hybrid model where certain decisions are controlled by token holders while others remain under team control.

**Characteristics:**
- **Decision Making**: Core parameters governed by token holder voting, technical decisions by core team
- **Community Input**: Formal proposal framework implemented
- **Proposal Creation**: Open to anyone holding at least 1% of circulating supply (individually or as a group)
- **On-Chain Actions**: Timelock contract implemented for critical parameter changes
- **Voting System**: Combination of off-chain voting for sentiment and on-chain voting for execution

**Governance Contracts:**
- Basic on-chain GovernorAlpha contract
- Timelock for parameter changes
- Staking contract integrated with voting power

### 3.3 Phase 3: Decentralization (18+ months)

The final phase represents full decentralization where all major decisions are made by token holders through on-chain governance.

**Characteristics:**
- **Decision Making**: DAO-controlled with minimal team intervention
- **Community Input**: Fully on-chain proposal and voting system
- **Proposal Creation**: Threshold lowered to 0.5% of circulating supply
- **Execution**: Automatic execution of passed proposals after timelock
- **Special Controls**: Guardian role only for critical security threats

**Governance Contracts:**
- Advanced Governor contract with delegation
- Treasury management contract
- Reputation-weighted voting
- Multiple timelock periods based on proposal impact

## 4. Governance Participants

### 4.1 Role-Based Governance

During the early phases, governance will include several defined roles:

- **Core Team**: The founding team members with administrative privileges
- **Technical Committee**: Responsible for assessing technical implementations and security
- **Community Representatives**: Elected members representing regular users
- **Guardian**: Emergency role that can pause proposals in case of security threats (Phase 1-2 only)

### 4.2 Token-Based Governance

As governance transitions to more decentralization, participation will shift to being primarily token-based:

- **ROXN Holders**: All token holders can vote directly on proposals
- **Stakers**: Users who stake tokens receive increased voting power
- **Delegates**: Users who accumulate delegated voting power from other token holders
- **Protocol-Owned Liquidity**: Treasury funds managed by governance

## 5. Proposal System

### 5.1 Proposal Types

The governance system supports several types of proposals:

- **Parameter Change**: Modify specific protocol parameters (e.g., reward distribution rates)
- **Treasury Allocation**: Proposals to spend from the community treasury
- **Protocol Upgrade**: Implement new features or smart contract upgrades
- **Ecosystem Grants**: Fund development of ecosystem projects and integrations
- **Governance Change**: Modify the governance process itself
- **Emergency Action**: Time-sensitive actions requiring rapid response

### 5.2 Proposal Lifecycle

Each proposal follows this lifecycle:

1. **Discussion**: Initial informal discussion in community forums
2. **Temperature Check**: Optional off-chain poll to gauge interest
3. **Formal Proposal**: Submission of proposal to governance system
4. **Review Period**: Time for community to review and discuss (3-7 days)
5. **Voting Period**: Active voting window (5-14 days depending on proposal type)
6. **Timelock**: Waiting period before implementation (1-14 days depending on impact)
7. **Execution**: Implementation of the approved proposal
8. **Post-Implementation Review**: Assessment of outcomes after implementation

### 5.3 Proposal Requirements

To create a formal proposal, the following requirements must be met:

**Phase 1:**
- Core team or strategic partner status

**Phase 2:**
- Hold or gather delegation of at least 1% of circulating supply
- Provide detailed implementation plan
- Include risk assessment

**Phase 3:**
- Hold or gather delegation of at least 0.5% of circulating supply
- Complete standardized proposal template
- Include technical specification for on-chain actions

## 6. Voting Mechanisms

### 6.1 Voting Power Calculation

Voting power is calculated based on several factors:

- **Base Voting Power**: 1 ROXN token = 1 vote
- **Staking Multiplier**: Additional voting power based on lock duration
  - 1-month lock: 1.2x multiplier
  - 3-month lock: 1.5x multiplier
  - 6-month lock: 2x multiplier
  - 12-month lock: 3x multiplier
- **Contribution Multiplier** (Phase 3): Additional voting power based on contribution history
  - Bronze contributor: 1.1x multiplier
  - Silver contributor: 1.2x multiplier
  - Gold contributor: 1.5x multiplier

### 6.2 Voting Periods

Different proposal types have different voting periods:

- **Standard Proposals**: 7 days
- **Critical Proposals** (parameter changes): 14 days
- **Emergency Proposals**: 2 days (requires Technical Committee approval)
- **Governance Changes**: 14 days

### 6.3 Quorum Requirements

For a proposal to pass, it must meet quorum requirements:

**Phase 1:**
- Non-binding, no quorum requirements

**Phase 2:**
- Standard Proposals: 10% of circulating supply participation
- Critical Proposals: 20% of circulating supply participation
- Simple majority required (>50% of votes)

**Phase 3:**
- Standard Proposals: 15% of circulating supply participation
- Critical Proposals: 30% of circulating supply participation
- Governance Changes: 40% of circulating supply participation
- Super majority required for critical changes (>66% of votes)

## 7. Integration with Staking

### 7.1 Staking for Voting Power

Staking serves as the primary mechanism for enhancing voting power:

- Tokens must be staked in dedicated governance staking contracts
- Staked tokens cannot be used for other purposes during the staking period
- Staking period begins when tokens are deposited
- Early unstaking carries penalties and immediately removes voting power

### 7.2 Voting Power Multipliers

The staking system applies multipliers based on lock duration:

```
Voting Power = Token Amount × Duration Multiplier × Contribution Multiplier
```

Example:
- 10,000 ROXN staked for 6 months (2x multiplier)
- Gold contributor status (1.5x multiplier)
- Resulting voting power = 10,000 × 2 × 1.5 = 30,000 votes

## 8. Timelock Mechanisms

### 8.1 Standard Timelock

Approved proposals enter a timelock before execution:

- **Parameter Changes**: 7-day timelock
- **Treasury Allocations**: 3-day timelock
- **Protocol Upgrades**: 14-day timelock
- **Governance Changes**: 14-day timelock

During the timelock period:
- Proposal can be viewed by anyone
- Technical Committee can review for security issues
- Guardian role can veto malicious proposals (Phase 1-2 only)

### 8.2 Emergency Execution

For time-sensitive issues, an emergency execution process exists:

- Requires unanimous approval from Technical Committee
- Guardian role must approve
- 24-hour minimum timelock
- Must be retrospectively ratified by standard governance process

## 9. Smart Contract Architecture

### 9.1 GovernorAlpha Contract

The primary governance contract based on proven governance systems:

```solidity
// Simplified structure
contract ROXNGovernor {
    // State variables
    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    uint256 public proposalCount;
    IERC20 public roxnToken;
    VotingPower public votingPower;
    Timelock public timelock;
    
    // Proposal threshold
    uint256 public proposalThreshold;
    
    // Voting periods
    uint256 public votingPeriod;
    
    // Quorum requirement
    uint256 public quorumVotes;
    
    // Events
    event ProposalCreated(...);
    event VoteCast(...);
    event ProposalQueued(...);
    event ProposalExecuted(...);
    
    // Core functions
    function propose(...) external returns (uint256) {...}
    function castVote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external {...}
    function queue(uint256 proposalId) external {...}
    function execute(uint256 proposalId) external {...}
    
    // View functions
    function state(uint256 proposalId) public view returns (ProposalState) {...}
    function getActions(uint256 proposalId) external view returns (...) {...}
    function getReceipt(uint256 proposalId, address voter) external view returns (...) {...}
}
```

### 9.2 Timelock Contract

Contract that enforces a waiting period before execution:

```solidity
contract ROXNTimelock {
    // State variables
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public queuedTransactions;
    address public admin;
    uint256 public delay;
    
    // Events
    event QueueTransaction(...);
    event ExecuteTransaction(...);
    event CancelTransaction(...);
    
    // Core functions
    function queueTransaction(...) external returns (bytes32) {...}
    function executeTransaction(...) external payable returns (bytes) {...}
    function cancelTransaction(...) external {...}
    
    // Guardian function (Phase 1-2 only)
    function emergencyCancel(bytes32 txHash) external onlyGuardian {...}
}
```

### 9.3 VotingPower Contract

Contract that calculates and tracks voting power:

```solidity
contract ROXNVotingPower {
    // State variables
    IERC20 public roxnToken;
    IStaking public stakingContract;
    IContributorRegistry public contributorRegistry;
    
    // Multipliers
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public durationMultipliers; // stake duration => multiplier
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) public contributorMultipliers; // contributor level => multiplier
    
    // Core functions
    function getVotingPower(address account) external view returns (uint256) {...}
    function getHistoricalVotingPower(address account, uint256 blockNumber) external view returns (uint256) {...}
    
    // Admin functions (governed by governance)
    function setDurationMultiplier(uint256 duration, uint256 multiplier) external onlyGovernance {...}
    function setContributorMultiplier(uint256 level, uint256 multiplier) external onlyGovernance {...}
}
```

## 10. Future Governance Roadmap

### 10.1 DAO Treasury Management

In Phase 3, the governance system will expand to include sophisticated treasury management:

- Diversification strategies for treasury assets
- Multiple sub-DAOs for different aspects of the ecosystem
- Grant allocation processes with milestone-based funding
- Revenue-generating strategies for long-term sustainability

### 10.2 On-Chain Reputation Systems

The eventual governance will incorporate on-chain reputation:

- Reputation scores based on contribution history
- Quadratic voting mechanisms to balance large and small token holders
- Contributor badges with special proposal rights
- Anti-sybil mechanisms to prevent reputation farming

### 10.3 Delegation Mechanisms

Advanced delegation features will be introduced:

- Liquid democracy mechanisms
- Domain-specific delegation (technical, treasury, marketing)
- Delegation rewards to incentivize active delegates
- Delegate accountability metrics

## 11. Governance Security

### 11.1 Multi-Signature Controls

Throughout all phases, critical functions will be secured by multi-signature control:

- Phase 1: 3-of-5 core team multi-sig for all functions
- Phase 2: 3-of-7 multi-sig with community representatives included
- Phase 3: 5-of-9 multi-sig for emergency functions only

### 11.2 Guardian Function

The Guardian role exists to protect against critical vulnerabilities:

- Can pause proposals during timelock
- Can freeze malicious transactions
- Requires unanimous Technical Committee approval to activate
- Will be removed entirely in Phase 3

### 11.3 Bug Bounty Programs

Security-focused programs to identify governance vulnerabilities:

- Rewards for identifying governance attack vectors
- Special escalation path for critical governance bugs
- Regular security audits of governance contracts
- Simulated governance attacks to test protections
